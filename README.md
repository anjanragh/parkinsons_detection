## DETECT PARKINSONS using OpenCV and ML

I am going to keep updating this readme till the code is complete. My goals are as follows:

- ~~Get the data~~
- ~~Clean the data and convert it into numerical points using openCV.~~
- ~~Try some classification algorithms like RandomForests~~ and SVM
- Also try DL architectures like CNN directly from the images. 
- Try to make a UI to showcase my results. 


Hopefully I'll get done with all this soon.
