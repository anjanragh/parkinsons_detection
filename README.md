## DETECT PARKINSONS using OpenCV and ML

I am going to keep updating this readme till the code is complete. My goals are as follows:

- Get the data 
- Clean the data and convert it into numerical points using openCV.
- Try some classification algorithms like RandomForests and SVM
- Also try DL architectures like CNN directly from the images. 
- Try to make a UI to showcase my results. 


Hopefully I'll get done with all this soon.
